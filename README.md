Documentation and Tools relating to Software Conversions

Documentation relating to certain issues with source code analysis, and at some point some projects (in C# most likely) that illustrate certain ideas.

Project migrations from one language to another are done by teams that form and split up without much regard to prior or successive projects.  Someone learns how to convert one language to another, finishes a migration, then moves on to some other project that is either new development or a conversion in unrelated languages. Any tools that were developed in that migration process may be 'orphaned'.  This makes a good case for open source migration tools - if someone has converted one language to another, publishing those tools gives other developers a starting base in situations where they can make constructive use of it.
